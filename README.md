## Quickstart

To calculate the final balance of a principal of $10,000, at a annual interest rat of 3%, re-invested monthly for 3 years (36 months)

```bash
npm run start
```

## Assumptions

### functionnal

- The interests are accrued monthly
- the result is rounded to the nearest dollar

### non-fonctionnal

- project is will not be used as a library
- the naming chosen within the project is considering that the project is self-contained and not part of a bigger codebase
- project setup is done for a minimal setup, not a full blown development environment
